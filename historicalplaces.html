    <p class="info">Harappa was one of the major urban centers of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, which
        thrived in the Bronze Age around 2600 to 1900 BCE. It is located in present-day Pakistan, about 20 miles
        southwest of Sahiwal.

        The Harappa civilization was discovered in the 1920s during archaeological excavations led by Sir John Marshall.
        The ruins of Harappa revealed a well-planned city with advanced urban infrastructure, including grid-like
        streets, well-built brick houses, and a complex drainage system. The city covered an area of approximately 150
        acres and is believed to have housed a population of around 40,000 to 50,000 people.

        The people of Harappa were highly skilled in various crafts, including pottery, metallurgy, and stone carving.
        They had an extensive trade network, with evidence of trade connections extending to <i>Mesopotamia</i>
        (modern-day
        Iraq) and other parts of the ancient world.

        The Harappan script, also known as the Indus script, was discovered at Harappa but remains undeciphered to this
        day. Therefore, our knowledge of the Harappan civilization relies mainly on the archaeological findings rather
        than written records.

        The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Harappa, is still a subject of debate among historians
        and archaeologists. It is believed that a combination of factors, such as environmental changes, shifts in river
        courses, and possibly socio-political changes, contributed to the decline and eventual abandonment of the
        cities.

        Harappa, along with the city of Mohenjo-daro, represents the zenith of the Indus Valley Civilization. These
        ancient cities provide valuable insights into the development of urban planning, social organization, and
        craftsmanship in the ancient world. They stand as a testament to the advanced and sophisticated cultures that
        thrived in the region thousands of years ago.</p>

    <!-- About Historical Place no.2 -->
    <p class="info">Mohenjo-daro was an ancient city located in the region of modern-day Pakistan, near the Indus
        River. It was one
        of the largest and most advanced urban centers of the Indus Valley Civilization, which thrived from around 2600
        to 1900 BCE during the Bronze Age.

        The name "Mohenjo-daro" means "Mound of the Dead" or "Mound of the Dead Men" in Sindhi. The city was discovered
        in the 1920s by archaeologist Sir John Marshall, and extensive excavations have revealed a wealth of information
        about the Indus Valley Civilization.

        Mohenjo-daro was a remarkably well-planned city, showcasing a sophisticated urban infrastructure for its time.
        The city covered an area of about 250 acres and housed a population estimated to be between 40,000 and 60,000
        people. It featured a grid-like street layout with well-built houses, public buildings, and a complex system of
        drainage and sanitation.

        The city had a centralized authority and displayed a high level of social organization. It is believed that the
        ruling elite, perhaps priests or wealthy merchants, governed the city, while the majority of the population
        engaged in various occupations such as farming, craftsmanship, and trade.

        Archaeological findings suggest that the people of Mohenjo-daro were skilled in craftsmanship, including
        pottery, metalworking, and bead making. They also had access to an extensive trade network that stretched across
        different regions, including <i>Mesopotamia</i> (modern-day Iraq) and possibly beyond.

        One of the notable structures at Mohenjo-daro is the Great Bath, which was a large public water tank built with
        bricks and covered with a waterproof lining. It is believed to have held religious or ritualistic significance.

        The decline and abandonment of Mohenjo-daro, similar to other cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, remain a
        subject of debate among historians and archaeologists. Possible factors contributing to the decline include
        environmental changes, changes in river courses, and possibly socio-political disruptions.

        Mohenjo-daro provides valuable insights into the urban planning, architecture, social structure, and daily life
        of the Indus Valley Civilization. Its ruins serve as a testament to the advanced level of civilization that
        existed in the region over 4,000 years ago.</p>
